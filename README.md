GORGE
=====

Endless shoot 'em up game.
It's still in development but already playable.
You'll need LÃ–VE 0.9.1 or newer.

### Controls ###
<table>
	<tr><td>arrow keys</td>			<td>move</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>x</code></td>
		<td>shoot</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>y</code> or <code>z</code></td>
		<td>activate force field/blast</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Gamepad works, too.
